# Coordinator Templates For Xcode

How To Install it:
1. Navigate to where Xcode stores its templates: In Finder, press Cmd+Shift+G to bring up the “Go to the folder…” prompt, and enter in this path: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/.

If you end up in a folder called “Templates”, you’re good to go. If you end up in a folder called “Xcode” it means you don’t have a Templates folder yet, so the first step is to create one: right-click in the window, choose New Folder, name it Templates, then navigate into it.

2. If you don't already have a `File Templates` folder in Templates, the create a sub folder and name it `File Templates`, for files templates (versus to `Project Templates`)

3. Copy `Design Patterns` folder to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates` to try it out. 

You're more then welcome to improve this template.

Regarding this last path component Source/ you'll find it in Xcode under the related category Source for both iOS and OS X.
