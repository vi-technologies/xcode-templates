# Coordinator Templates For Xcode

How To Install it:
1. Navigate to where Xcode stores its templates: In Finder, press Cmd+Shift+G to bring up the “Go to the folder…” prompt, and enter in this path: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/.

If you end up in a folder called “Templates”, you’re good to go. If you end up in a folder called “Xcode” it means you don’t have a Templates folder yet, so the first step is to create one: right-click in the window, choose New Folder, name it Templates, then navigate into it.

2. Create a sub folder of Templates, and name it `File Templates`, for files templates (and not `Project Templates`)

3. Create a sub folder of File Templates, and name it `Design Patterns`, for the section title in XCode

4. Create a sub folder of Design Patterns, and name it `Coordinator + MVVM`, for the section title in XCode

3. Copy to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Design Patterns/Coordinator + MVVM` to try it out. 

You're more then welcome to improve this template.
